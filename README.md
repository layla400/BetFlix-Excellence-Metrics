# BetFlix-Excellence-Metrics

This project analyzes the content success on Betflix, a video streaming company used for this study. The data for this project is sourced from Netflix, and we explore trends, patterns, and factors that contribute to the success of movies and TV shows on the platform.

# Project Context 
The goal of this project is to assess the success of Betflix (using Netflix data) content through data-driven analysis. We identify key attributes that drive content popularity, including genre, release year, average user ratings, and viewership numbers. The insights gathered from this analysis could help video streaming platforms make strategic decisions about content creation and curation.

## Project Motivation

Identify the top features that determine the success of a TV show or movie on Betflix.
Provide actionable insights that will guide content strategy decisions to maximize ROI. 
Build a predictive model to forecast the likelihood of success for upcoming content.

1. Introduction (30 seconds)
Start with a brief introduction of the data team : I'm Alex, I'm currently working as a Data Analyst at Betflix. The aim of today is to present the top features for a content to be successful on the platform. The data team is composed of 5 people. The data team worked on that project for the CEO. We all come from different backgrounds and experiences, so we can offer a complete analysis.

User Story : 
As Betflix's CEO,
I want the data team to collaborate to analyze our content spending strategies, because is too expensive to create good content to leave it to fail
so that we can allocate resources more effectively and increase overall ROI by investing in content that generates higher viewership. Set up some features and be able to predict the level of success a TV show or Movie will have.


2. Dashboard Overview (1 minute)
Context / Global data : Describe what the dashboard measures (Date range - Top 10 daily/monthly - What is IMBD (CEO might know but as a reminder : Our ratings are on a scale from 1 - 10. 1 meaning the title was terrible and one of the worst titles you've seen and 10 meaning you think it was excellent. Your rating is considered in the aggregated user rating for a title. If we have too few ratings, we withhold providing a rating until we have enough.).
Point out key metrics, charts, and graphs that are crucial to understanding the data.
5 differents charts to explain : 
  - As you can notice, the most relevant date for releasing content on the platform is on Friday
-  Top movies/shows by Final Weighted Score per Country : The first chart shows the most popular titles in the United States, based on their weighted score. It highlights the highest-rated series and movies, with a special focus on those that achieved the highest scores, such as "Squid Game" and "Maid."​
- Distribution of Genres by Age Rating :  The second chart provides an overview of the distribution of genres across age categories. It illustrates the relative popularity of each genre, with comedy and drama largely dominating the other categories. This chart helps visualize general genre trends across different age groups.

-Global Membership Growth:
Over the past 12 years, both our global revenue, stock price of Netflix and subscription base have shown steady, incremental growth. Since subscriptions are our primary source of revenue, there's a strong positive correlation between the two. This means that to boost revenue, our focus should be on producing content that drives subscription growth. Notably, in 2020, we witnessed the highest subscription growth in our history, which coincided with the release of the most successful content in that year.

-Impact of Successful Content on Memberships:
Using performance data from the last three years, we developed a scoring system based on a modified Bayesian Average to classify content as either successful or unsuccessful. The chart below illustrates the clear relationship between the release of successful content and the annual growth in subscription memberships. It highlights how consistently delivering high-performing content positively influences membership growth.




3. Key Insights (2 minutes)
Pick 2-3 key insights from the data that stand out (correlation between release date and stocks - Elements that contribute to higher rank of the content).
Use visuals from the dashboard to emphasize these points.
