## Looker Studio Dashboards and Insights

- As you can notice, the most relevant date for releasing content on the platform is on Friday
- 
-  Top movies/shows by Final Weighted Score per Country : The first chart shows the most popular titles in the United States, based on their weighted score. It highlights the highest-rated series and movies, with a special focus on those that achieved the highest scores, such as "Squid Game" and "Maid."​
-  
- Distribution of Genres by Age Rating :  The second chart provides an overview of the distribution of genres across age categories. It illustrates the relative popularity of each genre, with comedy and drama largely dominating the other categories. This chart helps visualize general genre trends across different age groups.

-Global Membership Growth:
Over the past 12 years, both our global revenue, stock price of Netflix and subscription base have shown steady, incremental growth. Since subscriptions are our primary source of revenue, there's a strong positive correlation between the two. This means that to boost revenue, our focus should be on producing content that drives subscription growth. Notably, in 2020, we witnessed the highest subscription growth in our history, which coincided with the release of the most successful content in that year.

-Impact of Successful Content on Memberships:
Using performance data from the last three years, we developed a scoring system based on a modified Bayesian Average to classify content as either successful or unsuccessful. The chart below illustrates the clear relationship between the release of successful content and the annual growth in subscription memberships. It highlights how consistently delivering high-performing content positively influences membership growth.
